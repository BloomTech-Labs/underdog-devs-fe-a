          <p className="text1">
            According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),
            67.8% of released state prisoners were arrested for a new crime
            within three years, and 76.7% were arrested within five years
            (Durose, Cooper, & Snyder, 2014). Reducing recidivism not only
            protects society at large, but also imporves the life quality of
            individual ex-prisoners.
          </p>
          <p className="text1">
            Incarceration rates in the U.S. began increasing dramatically in the
            1990s. The U.S. has the highest prison population of any country,
            comprising 25% of the world's prisoners.
          </p>
          <p className="text1">
            Out of a sample of 401,268 prisoners state prisoners released in
            2005:
            <br />
            68% of released prisoners were arrested within 3 years.
            <br />
            79% of released prisoners were arrested within 6 years.
            <br />
            83% of released prisoners were arrested within 9 years.
            <br />
            Using this study as a basepoint, one could state that the national
            recidivism rate is 83%

            Employment has long been recognized as having a negative

            Researchers also have found that unemployment is associated with
            reduced recidivism(Skardhamar & Telle, 2012). The strongest
            predictor for recidivism: poverty + unemployment.
